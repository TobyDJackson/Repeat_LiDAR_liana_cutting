This repo contains R code to reproduce the analysis in the manuscript: 

Liana cutting accelerates the structural recovery of Borneo's logged tropical forests
Jackson et al (in review)

There are six R scripts in this repo: 

SBE_height_carbon_analysis - does the main analysis of canopy height and carbon storage and produces Fig 1
SBE_raster_figures - produces figures 2 and S3-S5 showing the raster data
SBE_disturbance_processing - classifies the canopy dynamics
SBE_disturbance_analysis - summarizes and plots the canopy dynamics for Fig 3.
SBE_LAI_processing - calculates leaf area profiles from the LiDAR point clouds
SBE_LAI_analysis - plots the LAI profiles for Fig 4
