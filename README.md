This repo contains R code to reproduce the analysis in the manuscript: 

Liana cutting accelerates the structural recovery of Borneo's logged tropical forests
Jackson et al (in review)

There are six R scripts in this repo: 

SBE_analysis - does the main analysis of canopy structure and produces Fig 1, Fig 3 and S5-7
SBE_carbon_model - converts the changes in canopy height to carbon
SBE_LAI_processing - calculates leaf area profiles from the LiDAR point cloud
SBE_LAI_analysis - plots the LAI profiles for Fig 2 and Fig S4
SBE_disturbance_processing - classifies the canopy dynamics
SBE_disturbance_analysis - summarizes and plots the canopy dynamics for Fig 4.
